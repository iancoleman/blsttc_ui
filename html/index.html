            Step 1: All nodes generate their own unique secret (called a
            BivarPoly).
            This is used to derive the list of shares for
            the other nodes, shown in Step 2.

        <p>
            The value shown below is the public portion of node
            <span class="sender-id">0</span>'s BivarPoly.
            The public portion is shared to all nodes and combined into
            the group master public key in Step 5.

            has this list of shares.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are derived from the secret in Step 1 that only node

            has this list of shares.
        </p>

            These are used by node

            to generate their secret key share, shown in Step 4.
        </p>

            This is created by combining the shares received by node

            in Step 3.

    This tool is based on

    <p>
    Since wasm is quite limited in the interface between javascript and rust,
    this tool uses a rust wrapper around threshold_crypto which is relatively
    awkward, but this is just an implementation detail. Not all
    threshold_crypto functions are available in the wasm or this tool.
    </p>

    <p>
    threshold_crypto is very cautious about revealing secret keys. You should
    be too. You may find the secret keys in this tool are not compatible with
    other BLS tools. That's probably because secret keys are serialized from
    threshold_crypto using bincode.

    threshold_crypto uses curve

    BLS12-381</a>.

    <p>
    Since it's not abundantly obvious which source of randomness is used by
    threshold_crypto in SecretKey::random when compiled to wasm, the tool uses
    javascript Crypto.getRandomValues which has known assurances around the
    strength of the random values generated.
